    <h5><em>(Age Range: 3 - 6 Year Olds)</em></h5>
    <p>Our <em>Mini Artist</em> programme is a jammed packed creative arts session open for 3 to 6 year olds. The
focus of each session is to develop an understanding for the creative process whilst learning how to
use a range of art materials and the foundations of art – the elements of arts.</p>
    <p>Children love to paint and this makes up a key ingredient for each session, plus a range of paint
and print tools, various drawing medium, sculpting construction and crafting materials, your mini
artist will enjoy their time with us!</p>
    <p>Qualified and experienced teachers plan each session covering a range of art concepts which
secretly target various skill developments such as forming circles for the young ones or creating
circular pattern work with the children children. Each project encourages independence and
confidence. Some activities are repeated or presented in a different way to enhance learning and to
allow for new discoveries. We explore a theme each week to make connections with Mini's world.</p>

  <h2 id="artist-at-work">Artist @ Work</h2>
  <h5><em>(Age Range: 7 - 12 Year Olds)</em></h5>
  <p>Our <em>Artist @ Work</em> programme is designed for school aged children from 7 to 12 years old. Our
young artists will explore a range of fine art techniques ranging from drawing, painting, sculpting and
printing, as well as enjoying craft and textile based creations. Over the term, artists will create their
own visual art book which will showcase their ideas, technique exploration and practice drafts.</p>
  <p>Critical thinking and problem solving skills are also enhanced as we teach our young artists about
idea development and material exploration. Sometimes our imagined ideas do not match our
creative hands and that is ok. It is learning how to adjust our creative thinking that becomes
important in executing a finished artwork.</p>

themselves in their own unique way through our art journey.</p>

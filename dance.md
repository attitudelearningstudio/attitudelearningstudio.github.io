  <p>Watch your child shine with delight as they twirl, skip and leap to the music. Our caring teachers
encourage and praise their every effort. As they grow, the respect between student and teacher
becomes an anchor for a positive learning environment in the later years.</p>
  <p>Through dance, our students grow into confidence and resilient people. We want to see young
people succeed. As they master new skills, they build self-confidence. Larning how to learn is a skill
for life.</p>

  <h2>Classical Ballet</h2>
  <p>Recognised for the beauty and elegance, classical ballet is a widespread dance style that appeals to
young children who imagine themselves dancing on their tippy toes. Ballet is a highly technical form
of dance using its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It requires high level thinking and
develops excellent physical control and coordination. Ballet technique underpins all other dance
styles.</p>

  <h2>Creative Movements</h2>
  <h5><em>(Age Range: 3 - 6 Year Olds)</em></h5>
  <p>We help our 3 to 6 year olds develop coordination, rhythm, and self-discipline as they express
themselves through movement. Teaching aids include scarves, tambourines, pom pom etc. The
students learn to listen and follow instructions; learn basic locomotor movements; learn simple
dance terminology and concept; are exposed to different types of music and rhythms; learn to wait
their turn. We emphasise a non-competitive atmosphere.</p>

  <h2>Pre-Primary & Primary</h2>
  <p>We help each student create the firm foundation needed to improve and progress to the next level of
study. Core body strength, arms and correct turn out based on a student's anatomy and muscular
development are emphasised at the barre. Center work is focused on the basic of adagio (slow
controlled combination), preparation for pirouettes, simple turns across the floor, petit allegro and
grand allegro. Before advancing to the next level, students must be able to execute these basic
ballet exercises at the barre and in the center safely and correctly. Musicality is emphasised as
students are exposed to a variety of both classical and contemporary composers.</p>

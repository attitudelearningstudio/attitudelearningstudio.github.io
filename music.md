  <p>Music and maths are highly intertwined. By understanding beat, rhythm, and scales, children are
learning how to divide, create fractions, and recognised patterns. It seems that music wires a child's
brain to help better understand other areas of maths.</p>

  <h2>Baby Music</h2>
  <h5><em>(Age Range: 18 Months - 3 Years Old)</em></h5>
  <p><em>The Baby Music</em> programme focuses on building a strong musical foundation.</p>
  <p>Your child will develop their sense of independence, learn to focus and listen to instructions, identify
detailed features in music, recognise music notes and symbols and play a tune on the keyboard
while developing their self-confidence, memory, passion and respect for other.</p>

  <h2>Baby Graduate</h2>
  <h5><em>(For those who have completed Baby Music)</em></h5>
  <p><em>The Baby Graduate</em> class builds on the Baby Music programme by developing your child's keyboard

skills and preparing them for one-on-one piano, or other instrument studies. They'll learn self-
discipline, hand postures and detailed note recognition, while gaining finger control and improved

motor skills. They will also develop a singing voice and learn to sing in pitch – building their
confidence to perform and express themselves.</p>
